    <p>Serving as an outdoor community space since 1882, the one-acre site first hosted the Free School Society’s Public-School No.5, which provided free night classes for people of color in addition to regular schooling. The space became an important community amenity, with public education lectures being held frequently. Eventually the classes became a school that took up half the lot. Some of the space was then leased for apartments, and the rest of the land became Elizabeth Street Garden, owned by a man named Allan Reiver. Originally the green space was only available through an entrance through Reiver’s gallery. However, a handful of community members convinced Reiver to open an entrance on Elizabeth street in exchange for volunteers to maintain the space. In 2019 Allan Reiver passed away, and his son Joseph Reiver became the executive director of Elizabeth Street Garden, the volunteer-based nonprofit that manages the garden.

  In more recent history, the ownership and use of the land becomes more complicated. In 2012, City Council member Margaret Chin asked former mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration to include the lot as an affordable housing complex. Chin’s request was granted by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) in 2012. Not long after that, Community Board 2 (The representative of the garden) began fighting the effort to develop the lot, proposing alternate sites in the district. The garden has racked up support from local electeds, local press, and attorney Norman Siegel, the former executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. In response to the alternate suggestions of location for the housing complex Chin, the city council member who is pushing for the development suggests not only developing the garden, but the alternate plot of land as well. Chin, in support of her argument, mentions the thousands of elderly in need of affordable housing, and says that she grew up in the neighborhood and many people always questioned why they didn't build a residential building in place of the garden. She also says that for many years only people who were friendly with Reiver were allowed to enter the space, calling into question the validity of the garden as this “cornerstone of the community” narrative that Community Board 2 is claiming. Jeannine Kiely, the president of the Friends of the Elizabeth Street Garden says, “This [effort to save the garden] started from a grassroots initiative to get more open space, period,” she says. “What the gallery owner did in those prior years is irrelevant.”

Community Board 2 members, along with other community members in support of the garden note that Elizabeth Street Garden is an open green space in one of the densest urban areas in the nation. They hail the space as a cornerstone of the community. Elizabeth Street Garden is also the host to numerous community activities such as food drives hosted by The Bowery Mission. All of the events are free and accessible to the community members. There are also community gardening events, exercise events, movie screenings, and live music. The lawsuits pursued by the board are based on a claim that by using the space to develop affording housing is a violation of environmental law. In September, the garden held a benefit concert for Christina Yuna Lee, the 35-year-old woman who was brutally killed in her Chrystie Street apartment this past February in a crime that horrified New Yorkers.A GoFundMe memorial fund in Lee’s name has raised $430,000. It’s telling to look at what causes the fund supports: the Prospect Park Alliance (Lee’s favorite park); Womankind, originally New York Asian Women’s Center, serving survivors of domestic and sexual violence and trafficking; Planned Parenthood; SafeWalks, a group focused on female straphanger safety; and Elizabeth Street Garden. “Christina believed in the power of green and open spaces as opportunities for self-realization and exploration,” the fund’s page says. “Elizabeth Street Garden was one of her favorite places in New York — she often went there to read, sketch, listen to music and hear poetry. It was her personal oasis in the middle of the city.”

People are appalled not only by the use of a tragic woman's death as a means to prevent the development of a very needed affordable housing complex, but also the attempt to find a loophole in environmental law that will stop the development of affordable housing. A commenter on an article by The Village Sun titled “Editorial: Now’s the time to save the Elizabeth Street Garden” written on November 3rd, 2023 says, “
Yes, there is a lack of green space in Little Italy but the Liz Christy Garden is only a few blocks away and Sarah Roosevelt Park extends from Houston Street to Canal Street. You also neglect to mention that the garden was not opened to the public, and became a garden only after the art gallery owner was notified by the City of their plans to terminate his month-to-month lease on the property to build low-income housing.”
Although, it is not fair to negate the importance of this space to community members, and it does offer many necessary aspects that Little Italy/ChinaTown is lacking in terms of green space, I do think that as a community we have a responsibility to prioritize affordable housing for seniors over an open garden space if there are other greenspace options within a radius of a couple blocks. 
  On the first of March, On the same day I took the accompanying photographs, I interviewed a volunteer on shift at the garden. She refused to be photographed, but agreed to answer some questions regarding the lawsuit. The following text is a transcript of our brief conversation;

SA: So how long have you been volunteering in this space?

A: Ive been volunteering here for about 5 months.

SA: May I ask why you chose this particular space to volunteer at?

A: I used to come here all the time and I was looking for a space to garden and be outside, this seemed like the perfect place.

SA: That’s cool, have you been coming here long?

A: Since I moved to an apartment near here, I used to live by Fort Greene and I would be there all the time. This is the best green space here unless I want to walk 25 minutes to tompkins.

SA: Yeah I feel you. Could I ask you anything about the lawsuit regarding this space and the housing complex they want to build?

A: Ummm. I don't think I can say too much. I am aware of it. I know it went on for quite a while, and that this place won’t be here forever. I'm sad to see the space gone but I also think its important (the housing complex). There's not much I can do. I'm just volunteering here as long as I can. I enjoy the space and like the opportunity to be outside and tend to the garden. 

SA:  Yeah I understand if you can't say too much. Thanks for that though I appreciate you taking the time. Thank you.</p>
